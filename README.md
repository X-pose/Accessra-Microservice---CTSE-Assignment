# Accessra Microservice - CTSE Assignment

**Accessra** is a schema-based, multi-tenant authentication and authorization API built using **NestJS**, **TypeORM**, and **PostgreSQL**. Designed for SaaS platforms, it ensures strict tenant isolation and scalable user management using modern cloud-native tooling.

## 🏗️ Multi-Tenancy Architecture

Accessra follows a **schema-based multi-tenant** architecture:
- Each tenant's data is stored in a **separate PostgreSQL schema**, ensuring complete isolation.
- A **central database schema** manages tenant metadata, authentication credentials, and user assignments.
- Dynamic schema creation and connection logic are handled at runtime using custom TypeORM strategies.

This approach provides:
- ✅ Strong data isolation
- 📈 Easy scaling with minimal changes
- 🔄 Centralized user and tenant management
